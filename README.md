i have migrated to [fgit.tann](https://fgit.true1ann.me/true1ann).
all github pages websites will be soon be available only on:
- true1ann.github.io (which is going to be outdated)
- over [CFPW](https://cfpw.true1ann.me/cfpw)


ann.is-a.dev will be soon be attached to the CFPW instance and manually managed  
it was nice to be on github but i dont like it anymore
