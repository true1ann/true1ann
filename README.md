## Hello there!
She / Her • MtF train  
My mainline stuff I use & make goes here, usually. Soon more projects will be here.  

Other info, contacts, statuses, and more things are on my [website](https://ann.is-a.dev).  
<small>(We also have the [outdated](https://ann.is-a.dev/old-index.html) version hosted through GitHub Pages, soon frontend will move there)</small>

## Difference between `git`s
- **GitHub**: My public projects, ready to use for anyone  
- **[git.tann](https://git.true1ann.me)**: Betas of my projects  
- **[gitea.ann](https://gitea.ann.maxy.top)**: Soon is going to be outdated, same usage as git.tann
